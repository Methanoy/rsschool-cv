#### About Myself

In my work I have always been looking for an opportunity to expand the limits of knowledge, participate in interesting projects and feel the benefits of my work. At the same time I'm a lawyer, and my profession is associated with support someone who creating a product, while I would like to develop the products by myself.  
By 2019, I had already often encountered IT in my work (software delivery, SPA creation, cloud technologies) and came to the conclusion that I wanted to learn more about development and programming. Therefore, I began to study this area more, try different programming languages by SoloLearn / Coursera / Stepik / CodeAcademy, and by 2021 I finally decided to get a specialization of Frontend developer, so I signed up for Yandex.Practicum to study Web-development.
